Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                GNU AGPL v3.0

This license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other software is covered by the GNU General Public License instead.)

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, and that you can change the software and share your changes with others.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that you, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the AGPL must cause modified versions to be marked as changed, so that their changes are not mistaken for the original version.

This license explicitly requires that the source code be made available when the software is used over a network. This means that if you modify the software and use it to provide a service, you must make the modified source code available to the users of that service.
